# Climate Data Analysis Project

## Acknowledgment of running out of time
I ran out of time but wanted to submit work before the deadline so there is no Irish Data analysis although data is sourced and put in folder plus peredictions model is very basic and poor for the same reasons. 

Furthermore, there is a lack of academic references throughout the project too

I ill update my code post assignment and use it for my GirHub repository

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project presents a comprehensive analysis of paleo-present climate data, focusing on CO2, temperature anomalies, and methane (CH4) concentrations. The objective is to understand the historical context of climate change and predict future trends.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**: Overview of climate change, greenhouse gases, and their impact.
2. **CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly Analysis**: Analysis of CO2 concentrations and temperature anomalies over 800,000 years.
3. **Methane (CH4) Concentration Analysis**: Investigation of CH4 levels and their implications.
4. **Data Fusion and Analysis**: Integration and correlation analysis of CH4, CO2, and temperature anomalies.
5. **Future Predictions and Comparisons**: Forecasting future global temperature anomalies and comparison with established climate models.
6. **Accelerated Warming and Climate Impacts**: Discussion on recent climate trends and implications for policy and research.

## Data Sources
- Paleo data from ice core records.
- Recent CO2 measurements from Mauna Loa Observatory.
- NASA and NOAA databases for temperature and CH4 data.
- Irish meteorological studies for regional climate insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data processing and analysis.
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Statsmodels for time series analysis.

## Acknowledgements
Data and insights sourced from IPCC, NOAA, NASA, WMO, and online forums have been instrumental in this analysis.
